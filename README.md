<br>  
  All the files are required.  <br>
  The default repository format for 3D files is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. 
<br>  
  The default repository format for PCB files is <a targer="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format">GERBER</a> .
<br>

<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kicad.org/" >KiCad </a> may prove suitable for viewing GERBER files.

## Use Case
There are two scenarios envisaged for this design
- Read only EEPROM Data Pack
- Top Slot Hardware testing in conjunction with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nofitnessforpurpose/TopSlotSpy" >Top Slot Spy</a>

There are a number of types of Data Pack, the first iteration is intended to support Linear addressed packs:  
Data Pack Type Summary  
Size	Type  
8K	Linear  
16K	Linear  
32K	Linear / Paged  
64K	Linear / Paged  
128K	Segmented and Paged  
  
RAMPACKS  
32K	Paged  
64K	Paged  
128K	Segmented and Paged  
  
In summary supported are 8 to 64 K Linear Data Packs, or devices emulating these pack addressing schemes.
  
  
## Considerations
The 3D model makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below.  
The PCB is currently beta and has NOT been tested, it remains your responsiblity to asses suitability!  
The assembly of PCB and case has not been tested.  
Many pieces of software, including the authors ;-) may accidently, never have considerd allowing selection of Pack D: in menus.  


## Questions / Discussion
See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.organiser2.com/"> Organiser 2 Hardware </a> forum, though see note below first.
